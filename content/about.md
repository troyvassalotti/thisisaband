title: What Is This?
---

One night, I was looking for a new domain to buy and stumbled upon _thisisa.band_. It served a completely different purpose at the time, but it wasn't long before I thought of a better way to put this internet real estate to use. _This Is A Band_ is a place for you to spread the word about the bands in your life, but not just for the hell of it.

- Did you see this amazing band on your travels in Europe that you'd never heard of and think everyone else needs to hear them?
- While you were on tour with your own band, did you perform alongside just the greatest people you'd ever met and feel like everyone else needs to know how great they were?
- Maybe you were going through a tough time a few years ago and this one band was the reason you're where you are today?

Whatever the reason is, _This Is A Band_ is the place to talk about it.
